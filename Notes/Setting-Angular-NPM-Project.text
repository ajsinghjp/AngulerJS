our steps must be in this order:

1) Install angular globally : npm install -g angular-cli@latest
       ng - v to check angular cli version
2) Create the app at a directory location (setup anguler cli project) : ng new portal  -- routing
3) Go into that folder : cd portal
4) type command : ng serve (Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200)
